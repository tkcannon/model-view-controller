# The Tech Blog

## Description 
This app was created for a challenge through the University of Utahs Coding Bootcamp. It functions as a basic blog site with user accounts, posts, and comments. The styling is very basic and still unfinished.

## Usage

On page load existing posts are visable on the home page. Selecting a post displays that post along with any comments that have been made for said post. Users can use the navigation bar at the top right of the page to return to the homepage, login, or sign-up. After sign-up new users are automatically logged-in. Upon login users are brought to thier dashboard where they can view any posts they have made, as well as create new posts. Selecting an existing post brings users to an edit page where they can change the posts text content or delete the post. Users can return to the homepage at any time by selecting home from the nav bar.
